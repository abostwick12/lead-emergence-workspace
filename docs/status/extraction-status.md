## Gate status

- Gate A: **Complete** — Workspace schemas, RLS/grants, storage policy, and cross-product controls validated.
- Gate B: **Complete** — approved Workspace data migrated and reconciled; no Workspace Storage objects migrated.
- Gate C: **Complete** — production Workspace live and accepted.
- Gate D: **Cutover complete; stabilization in progress** — Ministry navigation removed, legacy UI routes redirected, legacy APIs retired, the confirmed legacy tables write-frozen, D1/D2 deployed, clocks deployed, and production smoke/security checks passed.

Hosted migration history records `20260821181638_ministry_gmail_boundary`, `20260821191020_workspace_clock_preferences`, and `20260821191057_legacy_command_center_write_freeze`. The clock package SHA-256 is `05e100e3f5f2c7b041ba9bc1373912d9f26f4d8fbe125831f45ab7304dde85d2`.

The seven retained legacy tables remain readable with their pre-cutover counts: `personal_tasks` 0, `daily_briefing_cache` 1, `ai_conversations` 18, `personal_integrations` 7, `sage_memory` 0, `capture_inbox` 0, and `job_applications` 0. Each has one statement-level `gate_d_legacy_write_freeze` trigger covering INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. No legacy record was deleted, moved, or overwritten.

The Ministry Gmail boundary is deployed and does not use `personal_integrations`. `lead_emergence_private.ministry_gmail_tokens` remains empty, so Ministry Gmail actions are explicitly unavailable until a separate Ministry OAuth authorization is completed. No personal token was copied or reused.

Workspace uploads remain disabled and personal integrations remain reconnect-required. Consulting OS was not changed. The daily stabilization heartbeat `lead-emergence-stabilization-monitor` is active for 14 runs. Legacy cleanup is not authorized and requires a separate approval after stabilization.

Rollback remains viable: redeploy the recorded pre-Gate-D application sources, then apply a reviewed rollback migration that removes only the seven freeze triggers and their private trigger function. Retain the additive clock preference column and all legacy/Workspace evidence.

## Goal C — Workspace / Personal productization

Status: **local candidate validated; Workspace and Entry PRs are open and green; the Workspace Preview build is green; hosted schema/Auth configuration and authenticated Preview acceptance remain; hosted migration and production cutover are not approved**.

The productization source adds one-login Personal SSO consumption, shared native and AI-assisted setup, Workspace MCP authorization, Personal plan/capability resolution, plan-safe Settings, first-value Home behavior, useful empty states, and production operations documentation. The custom Workspace domain was already healthy before this goal; the Vercel rollback URL remains available.

No Goal C migration has been applied to the shared hosted project. The ministry repository remains its sole migration authority. No Goal C PR has been merged, no real user has been migrated or activated, no external connector token has been copied, no billing/trial/pricing has been activated or invented, and no production-cutover gate approval is recorded here.

Workspace PR [#4](https://github.com/abostwick12/lead-emergence-workspace/pull/4) and Entry PR [#2](https://github.com/abostwick12/lead-emergence-entry/pull/2) are open and mergeable. Workspace Vercel Preview checks are green; Entry's final quality rerun is recorded in `docs/testing/test-evidence.md`. Authenticated Vercel inspection verified the final runtime-bearing Workspace and Entry branch deployments READY, both Next.js builds successful, zero error-level runtime events, zero 5xx error events, and environment-specific origins. Production `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and `WORKSPACE_MCP_RESOURCE_URI` are canonical at `https://workspace.leademergence.com`; Preview uses its branch origin. Entry Preview routes Personal to the Workspace branch origin. The protected Workspace Preview renders the productized public sign-in and safe rollback state without console errors, but Entry OIDC correctly fails closed until the environment-specific provider/client, OAuth application, and hosted schema are provisioned. Therefore authenticated Preview and productized custom-domain acceptance are not yet claimable.

The hosted Goal C path remains explicitly gated. The shared production Supabase migration history does not contain the Goal C migration. The existing Personal sandbox is inactive and cannot be restored while the organization is at its two-active-Free-project limit; creating a Supabase Preview branch requires a paid Pro upgrade. Pausing the active Entry or Consulting sandbox would affect a sibling workstream and is not authorized. Applying Goal C to the shared hosted project requires the written gate here plus execution by the ministry repository, which remains the sole migration authority. None of those choices has been made.

Entry SSO source and its isolated Preview are green, but authenticated Vercel/DNS inventory found no designated live Entry project or custom-domain origin. `www.leademergence.com` remains the Ministry application. A live Entry authority must be explicitly designated or provisioned before Production one-login/routing can be accepted; no Ministry route or production alias was changed by this audit.

Current shared-project security advisors report no finding against `workspace`, `workspace_private`, or Workspace Storage. One project-level Auth warning reports leaked-password protection disabled; the remaining existing warnings concern other shared-project schemas/products and are outside Goal C. Post-Goal-C hosted advisors cannot be claimed until the approved migration path exists.

Local and external acceptance evidence is recorded in `docs/testing/test-evidence.md`: all required application checks, a fresh database rebuild, 85 pgTAP assertions, 8 desktop/mobile browser cases, database lint, full dependency audit, boundary scan, sensitive-data scan, green PR checks, and custom-domain/TLS baseline checks pass. This evidence is not a hosted-migration or cutover approval.
